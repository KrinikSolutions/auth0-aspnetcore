# Auth0 ASP.NET Core Guide

Welcome to the Auth0 ASP.NET Core Guide. This website will guide you through implementing Auth0 in your ASP.NET Core project.

## Overview of ASP.NET Core support

Auth0 supports standards such as the OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 protocols, meaning you can make use of the standard middleware supplied with ASP.NET Core in order to integrate Auth0 into your application. 

We do understand however that configuring these middleware can be time consuming or error prone, so to aid you in this we have supplied a set of extension methods which will help you in integrating Auth0 into your application.

On this website you will also find extensive examples that will guide you through integrating Auth0 in your application, no matter which configuration you are using.

Further to the middleware configuration extensions, we also provide a tag helper support to integrate [Lock](https://auth0.com/docs/libraries/lock) into your own applications.

Please refer to the [Guide section](xref:Guide) of this website for more information.
